## Project for Fundamentals of A.I. (Part 2) - module taken at KU Leuven
The objective of part 2 of the project was to model the classic Pacman as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. The following algorithms were implemented for multi-agent pacman.

- Minimax (with and without alpha-beta pruning)
- Expectimax

Evaluation functions were also created for the evaluation of gamestates. 
The only file that were changed was multiAgents.py, everything else was provided.
